This program solves a word puzzle where the goal is to turn one word for another
by exchanging one letter at a time, with all intermediate steps being valid
words.

Running the program requires a list of valid words in the puzzle's language.
Such a list can be found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words or locally on
a Unix system at `/usr/share/dict/words`.
